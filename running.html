<h1>Cross Country/Track & Field</h1>
<p>I have been a competitive runner since 2010. I ran track and cross country all through high school, college, <br>
    and even a season in grad school. I have had a lot of fun with it in the past, and I still run frequently <br>
    in my spare time. My life goal is to run a mile in under 4 minutes some day.  Frankly, I haven't come very <br>
    close to that yet, but you have to have dreams that you can work for! If anyone is curious (or if you are <br>
    thinking about challenging me to a race), here are my best times from college:

Because I enjoy reading about running and because I like to make tables in HTML, here are my favorite books about running:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Author</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>Once a Runner</i></td>
        <td>John L. Parker, Jr.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>Born to Run</i></td>
        <td>Christopher McDougall</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>Running with the Buffaloes&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></td>
        <td>Chris Lear</td>
    </tr>
</table>
